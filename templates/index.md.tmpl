## Best Practices
1. The parent resource attributes of a certain resource (e.g. groupnet field of subnet resource) can only be designated
   at creation. Once designated, they cannot be modified except for parent resource renaming.
2. The name of a resource is modifiable, but it is necessary to make sure its name referenced in the child resources
   is also updated (can be done manually or use reference resource_id.name).
3. Resources with child resources cannot be deleted independently. Use terraform destroy to delete all resources directly
   or delete all the child resources at the same time (depends_on is recommended to manage resources, serving as a
   precheck for delete operations).
