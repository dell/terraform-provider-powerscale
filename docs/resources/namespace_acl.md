# powerscale_namespace_acl (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Namespace ACL on PowerScale Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the Namespace ACL using this resource. We can also import the existing Namespace ACL from PowerScale array. Note that, when creating the resource, we actually load Namespace ACL from PowerScale to the resource state.


## Example Usage

```terraform

# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If only namespace is provided, `terraform apply` will load Namespace ACL from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load Namespace ACL (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting Namespace ACL from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale Namespace ACL allow you to manage the access control list for a namespace.
resource "powerscale_namespace_acl" "example_namespace_acl" {
  # Required and immutable once set
  namespace = "ifs/example"

  #   # Optional query parameters
  #   nsaccess = true
  #
  #   # Optional fields both for creating and updating
  #   # For owner and group, please provide either the UID/GID or the name+type

  #   group = {
  #     name = "Isilon Users",

  #   }
  #
  #   # acl_custom is required for updating. It can be set to [] to remove all acl.
  #   # While creating, if owner or group is provided, acl_custom must be specified as well. If none of
  #   # the three parameters are provided, Terraform will load the settings from the array directly.
  #   # For trustee, please provide either the UID/GID or the name+type
  #   # Please notice, the field acl_custom is the raw configuration, PowerScale will identify and calculate the accessrights
  #   # and inherit_flags provided and return its effective settings, which will be represented in the field acl in state.

  #       }

# After the execution of above resource block, Namespace ACL would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# Namespace ACL would have been updated on PowerScale.

### Required

- `namespace` (String) Indicate the namespace to set/get acl.

### Optional

- `acl_custom` (Attributes List) Customer's raw configuration of the JSON array of access rights. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--acl_custom))

# Example:
terraform import powerscale_namespace_acl.namespace_acl_test namespace_path
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
