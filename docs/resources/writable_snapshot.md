# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Writable Snapshot Details from PowerScale, and save to
# terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load Writable Snapshot Details (if not loaded).
# `terraform destroy` will delete the Writable Snapshot resource from terraform state file as well as from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.


# Scenario 1
# To create multiple writable snapshots using a snap id

# snapshot ID for which writable snapshot needs to be created
variable "snap_id" {
  description = "The ID of the source snapshot"
  type        = string
  # default     = "snap_id"
}

# Number of writable snapshots to be created from the snap_id
variable "num_writable_snapshots" {
  description = "The number of writable snapshots to create"
  type        = number
  default     = 3
}

# Example to create multiple writable snapshots from a single snapshot
resource "powerscale_writable_snapshot" "writablesnap_multiple1" {
  count = var.num_writable_snapshots

  dst_path = "/ifs/writable_snapshot_snap${count.index}"
  snap_id  = var.snap_id
}


# Scenario 2
# To create multiple writable snaphots using datasource

# Fetch snapshot data using snapshot datasource filters
data "powerscale_snapshot" "all" {
  filter {
    # sort = "created"
    # dir = "asc"
    # limit = 5
  }
}

# output command to verify the fetched snapshot
output "powerscale_snapshot_all_snaps" {
  value = data.powerscale_snapshot.all.snapshots_details
}

# create multiple writable snapshots with snap id fetched using datasource
locals {
  writable_snapshots = [
    for i, snap in data.powerscale_snapshot.all.snapshots_details : {
      dst_path = "/ifs/writable_snapshot${i}"
      snap_id  = snap.id
    }
  ]
}

resource "powerscale_writable_snapshot" "writablesnap_multiple2" {
  for_each = { for snap in local.writable_snapshots : snap.dst_path => snap }

  dst_path = each.value.dst_path
  snap_id  = each.value.snap_id
}


# Scenario 3
# To create a single writable snapshot

resource "powerscale_writable_snapshot" "writablesnap_single" {
  # dst_path is the path of the writable snapshot.
  dst_path = "/ifs/writable_snapshot"

  # snap_id is the source snapshot of the writable snapshot.
  snap_id = "snap_id"
}

# After the execution of above resource block, single/multiple Writable Snapshot(s) would have been cached in terraform state file, and
# Single/Multiple new Writable Snapshot(s) would have been created on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_writable_snapshot.writablesnap <path of the Snapshot>
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_writable_snapshot.writablesnap "/ifs/abcd"
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
