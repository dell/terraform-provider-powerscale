# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Writable Snapshot Details from PowerScale, and save to
# terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load Writable Snapshot Details (if not loaded).
# `terraform destroy` will delete the Writable Snapshot resource from terraform state file as well as from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

resource "powerscale_writable_snapshot" "writablesnap" {
  # dst_path is the path of the writable snapshot.
  dst_path = "/ifs/abcd"

  # snap_id is the source snapshot of the writable snapshot.
  snap_id = "5709"
}

# After the execution of above resource block, Writable Snapshot Settings would have been cached in terraform state file, and
# A new Writable Snapshot would have been created on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
