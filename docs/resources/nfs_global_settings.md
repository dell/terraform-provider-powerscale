# powerscale_nfs_global_settings (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the NFS Global Settings of PowerScale Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the NFS Global Settings using this resource.  
Note that, NFS Global Settings is the native functionality of PowerScale. When creating the resource, we actually load NFS Global Settings from PowerScale to the resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform

# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load NFS global settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load NFS global settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting NFS global settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale NFS Global Settings allow you to configure NFS global settings on PowerScale.
resource "powerscale_nfs_global_settings" "example" {
  # Optional fields both for creating and updating
  #  nfsv3_enabled = true
  #  nfsv3_rdma_enabled = false
  #  nfsv4_enabled = false
  #  rpc_maxthreads = 16
  #  rpc_minthreads = 16
  #  rquota_enabled = false
  #  service = true
}

# After the execution of above resource block, NFS global settings would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# NFS global settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
