# powerscale_quota (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Quota entity of PowerScale Array. Quota module monitors and enforces administrator-defined storage limits. We can Create, Update and Delete the Quota using this resource. We can also import an existing Quota from PowerScale array.

## Schema

### Required

- `include_snapshots` (Boolean) If true, quota governs snapshot data as well as head data.
- `path` (String) The ifs path governed.
- `type` (String) The type of quota.

### Optional

- `container` (Boolean) If true, quotas using the quota directory see the quota thresholds as share size.
- `enforced` (Boolean) True if the quota provides enforcement, otherwise an accounting quota.
- `force` (Boolean) Force creation of quotas on the root of /ifs or percent based quotas.
- `ignore_limit_checks` (Boolean) If true, skip child quota's threshold comparison with parent quota path.
- `linked` (Boolean) For user, group and directory quotas, true if the quota is linked and controlled by a parent default-* quota. Linked quotas cannot be modified until they are unlinked. Computed by PowerScale, do not set Linked while creating.
- `persona` (Attributes) Specifies the persona of the file group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--persona))
- `thresholds` (Attributes) The thresholds of quota (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--thresholds))
- `thresholds_on` (String) Thresholds apply on quota accounting metric.
- `zone` (String) Optional named zone to use for user and group resolution.

### Read-Only

- `efficiency_ratio` (Number) Represents the ratio of logical space provided to physical space used. This accounts for protection overhead, metadata, and compression ratios for the data.
- `id` (String) The system ID given to the quota.
- `notifications` (String) Summary of notifications: 'custom' indicates one or more notification rules available from the notifications sub-resource; 'default' indicates system default rules are used; 'disabled' indicates that no notifications will be used for this quota.; 'badmap' indicates that notification rule has problem in rule map.
- `ready` (Boolean) True if the default resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `reduction_ratio` (Number) Represents the ratio of logical space provided to physical data space used. This accounts for compression and data deduplication effects.
- `usage` (Attributes) The usage of quota (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--usage))

<a id="nestedatt--persona"></a>
### Nested Schema for `persona`

Optional:

- `id` (String) Specifies the serialized form of a persona, which can be 'UID:0', 'USER:name', 'GID:0', 'GROUP:wheel', or 'SID:S-1-1'.
- `name` (String) Specifies the persona name, which must be combined with a type.
- `type` (String) Specifies the type of persona, which must be combined with a name.


<a id="nestedatt--thresholds"></a>
### Nested Schema for `thresholds`

Optional:

- `advisory` (Number) Usage bytes at which notifications will be sent but writes will not be denied.
- `hard` (Number) Usage bytes at which further writes will be denied.
- `percent_advisory` (Number) Advisory threshold as percent of hard threshold. Usage bytes at which notifications will be sent but writes will not be denied. Must be >= 0.01 <= 99.99, precision 2
- `percent_soft` (Number) Soft threshold as percent of hard threshold. Usage bytes at which notifications will be sent and soft grace time will be started. Must be >= 0.01 <= 99.99, precision 2
- `soft` (Number) Usage bytes at which notifications will be sent and soft grace time will be started.
- `soft_grace` (Number) Time in seconds after which the soft threshold has been hit before writes will be denied.

Read-Only:

- `advisory_exceeded` (Boolean) True if the advisory threshold has been hit.
- `advisory_last_exceeded` (Number) Time at which advisory threshold was hit.
- `hard_exceeded` (Boolean) True if the hard threshold has been hit.
- `hard_last_exceeded` (Number) Time at which hard threshold was hit.
- `soft_exceeded` (Boolean) True if the soft threshold has been hit.
- `soft_last_exceeded` (Number) Time at which soft threshold was hit


<a id="nestedatt--usage"></a>
### Nested Schema for `usage`

Read-Only:

- `applogical` (Number) Bytes used by governed data apparent to application.
- `applogical_ready` (Boolean) True if applogical resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `fslogical` (Number) Bytes used by governed data apparent to filesystem.
- `fslogical_ready` (Boolean) True if fslogical resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `fsphysical` (Number) Physical data usage adjusted to account for shadow store efficiency
- `fsphysical_ready` (Boolean) True if fsphysical resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `inodes` (Number) Number of inodes (filesystem entities) used by governed data.
- `inodes_ready` (Boolean) True if inodes resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `physical` (Number) Bytes used for governed data and filesystem overhead.
- `physical_data` (Number) Number of physical blocks for file data
- `physical_data_ready` (Boolean) True if physical_data resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `physical_protection` (Number) Number of physical blocks for file protection
- `physical_protection_ready` (Boolean) True if physical_protection resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `physical_ready` (Boolean) True if physical resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.
- `shadow_refs` (Number) Number of shadow references (cloned, deduplicated or packed filesystem blocks) used by governed data.
- `shadow_refs_ready` (Boolean) True if shadow_refs resource accounting is accurate on the quota. If false, this quota is waiting on completion of a QuotaScan job.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_quota.quota_example [<zoneID>]:<id>
# Example 1: <zoneID> is Optional, defaults to System:
terraform import powerscale_quota.quota_example example_quota_id
# Example 2:
terraform import powerscale_quota.quota_example zone_id:example_quota_id
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
