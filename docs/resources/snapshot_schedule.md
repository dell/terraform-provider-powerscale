# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create NFS export on specified paths on the PowerScale Array.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale SMB shares provide clients network access to file system resources on the cluster

  # Required name of snapshot schedule for creating
  name = "test_snap_schedule"

  # Optional fields

  # The path snapshotted. Default set to : "/ifs"
  # path = "/ifs/tfacc_test"

  # Time value in String for which snapshots created by this snapshot schedule should be retained. Values supported are of format :

  # retention_time = "3 Hour(s)" 

  # Alias name to create for each snapshot.
  # alias = "snap_alias"

  # Pattern expanded with strftime to create snapshot names. Some sample values for pattern are: 'snap-%F' would yield snap-1984-03-20 , 'backup-%FT%T' would yield backup-1984-03-20T22:30:00".

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The schedule name.

### Optional

- `alias` (String) Alias name to create for each snapshot.
- `duration` (Number) Time in seconds added to creation time to construction expiration time.
- `next_run` (Number) Unix Epoch time of next snapshot to be created.
- `next_snapshot` (String) Formatted name (see pattern) of next snapshot to be created
- `path` (String) The /ifs path snapshotted.
- `pattern` (String) Pattern expanded with strftime to create snapshot names.Some sample values for pattern are: 'snap-%F' would yield snap-1984-03-20 , 'backup-%FT%T' would yield backup-1984-03-20T22:30:00
- `retention_time` (String) Time value in String for which snapshots created by this snapshot schedule should be retained.Values supported are of format : Never Expires, x Seconds(s), x Minute(s), x Hour(s), x Week(s), x Day(s), x Month(s), x Year(s) where x can be any integer value
- `schedule` (String) The isidate-compatible natural language description of the schedule. It specifies the frequency of the schedule. You can specify this as combination of <interval> and <frequency> where each of them can be defined as:

				Additionally:
					<integer> can include "st," "th," or "rd," e.g., "Every 1st month."
					<day> can be a day of the week or a three-letter abbreviation, e.g., "saturday" or "sat."
					<month> must be the name of the month or its abbreviation, e.g., "July" or "Jul."
				Some sample values:  "Every 2 days.", "Every 3rd weekday at 11 PM.", "Every month on the 15th at 1:30 AM."
