# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Cluster SNMP Settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load CLuster SNMP Settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting SNMP Settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale Cluster SNMP Settings allow you to change the settings of SNMP
resource "powerscale_cluster_snmp" "example_snmp_settings" {
  # Required field
  enabled = true //enables/disables cluster SNMP Settings

  # Optional fields both for creating and updating

  # read_only_community ="Public"
  # snmp_v1_v2c_access = true
  # snmp_v3_auth_protocol = "SHA"
}
# After the execution of above resource block, Cluster SNMP Settings would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# SNMP Settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
