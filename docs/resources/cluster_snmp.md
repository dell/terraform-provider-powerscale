# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Cluster SNMP Settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load CLuster SNMP Settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting SNMP Settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale Cluster SNMP Settings allow you to change the settings of SNMP
resource "powerscale_cluster_snmp" "example_snmp_settings" {
  # Required field
  enabled = true //enables/disables cluster SNMP Settings

  # Optional fields both for creating and updating

  # read_only_community ="Public"
  # snmp_v1_v2c_access = true
  # snmp_v3_auth_protocol = "SHA"
}
# After the execution of above resource block, Cluster SNMP Settings would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# SNMP Settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_cluster_snmp.example_snmp_settings <anyString>
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_cluster_snmp.example_snmp_settings "cluster_snmp"
# after running this command, populate the enabled field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# If enabled is true, then snmp_v1v2_access otherwise snmp_v3_access must be populated.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
