# powerscale_nfs_zone_settings (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the NFS Zone Settings of PowerScale Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the NFS Zone Settings using this resource.  
		Note that, NFS Zone Settings is the native functionality of PowerScale. When creating the resource, we actually load NFS Zone Settings from PowerScale to the resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform

# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load NFS zone settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load NFS zone settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting NFS zone settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale NFS zone settings allow you to configure NFS zone settings on PowerScale.
resource "powerscale_nfs_zone_settings" "example" {

  # Required field both for creating and updating
  zone = "tfaccAccessZone"

  # Optional fields both for creating and updating
  #  nfsv4_no_names = false
  #  nfsv4_replace_domain = true
  #  nfsv4_allow_numeric_ids = true
  #  nfsv4_domain = "localdomain_tfaccAZ"
  #  nfsv4_no_domain = false
  #  nfsv4_no_domain_uids = true
}

# After the execution of above resource block, NFS zone settings would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# NFS zone settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Required

### Optional

- `nfsv4_allow_numeric_ids` (Boolean) If true, sends owners and groups as UIDs and GIDs when look up fails or if the 'nfsv4_no_name' property is set to 1.
- `nfsv4_domain` (String) Specifies the domain or realm through which users and groups are associated.
- `nfsv4_no_domain` (Boolean) If true, sends owners and groups without a domain name.
- `nfsv4_no_domain_uids` (Boolean) If true, sends UIDs and GIDs without a domain name.
- `nfsv4_no_names` (Boolean) If true, sends owners and groups as UIDs and GIDs.
- `nfsv4_replace_domain` (Boolean) If true, replaces the owner or group domain with an NFS domain name.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of NFS Zone Settings. Value of ID will be same as the access zone.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_nfs_zone_settings.example zone
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_nfs_zone_settings.example tfaccAccessZone
# after running this command, populate the zone field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
