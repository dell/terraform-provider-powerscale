# powerscale_snapshot (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Snapshot entity of PowerScale Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the Snapshot using this resource. We can also import an existing Snapshot from PowerScale array. PowerScale Snapshots is a logical pointer to data that is stored on a cluster at a specific point in time.

# Available actions: Create, Update (name, expire), Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new snapshot for the path name set in `path` attribute on the PowerScale

# Note: This resource can be used to create a manual snapshot at a single point in time. Howerver, if the user wants to take snapshots on a regular cadence, they should use the snapshot_schedules resource. 

# PowerScale Snapshots is a logical pointer to data that is stored on a cluster at a specific point in time.
resource "powerscale_snapshot" "snap" {

  # Required path to the filesystem to which the snapshot will be taken of
  # This cannot be changed after create
  path = "/ifs/tfacc_file_system_test"

  # Optional name of the new snapshot. If unset uses the current date and time for the name attribute (Can be modified)
  name = "tfacc_snapshot_1"

  # Optional set_expires The amount of time from creation before the snapshot will expire and be eligible for automatic deletion.  (Can be modified)
  # Options: Never(default if unset), 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month.
  set_expires = "1 Day"
}

# After the execution of above resource block, snapshot would have been created on the PowerScale array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

- `size` (Number) The amount of storage in bytes used to store this snapshot.
- `state` (String) Snapshot state.
- `target_id` (Number) The ID of the snapshot pointed to if this is an alias. 18446744073709551615 (max uint64) is returned for an alias to the live filesystem.

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_snapshot.test <id>
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_snapshot.test id
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
