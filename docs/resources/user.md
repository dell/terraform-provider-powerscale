# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new user with the name set in `name` attribute on the PowerScale.

# PowerScale User allows you to authenticate through a local authentication provider. Remote users are restricted to read-only operations.

  # Required name for creating
  name = "testUserResourceSample"

  # Optional query_force. If true, skip validation checks when creating user. The force option is required for user ID changes.
  # query_force = false

  # Optional query_zone, will return user according to zone. Specifies the zone that the user will belong to when creating. Once user is created, its zone cannot be changed.
  # query_zone = "testZone"

  # Optional query_provider, will return user according to provider. Specifies the provider that the user will belong to when creating. Once user is created, its provider cannot be changed.
