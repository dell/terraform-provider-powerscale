# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Cluster identity Settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load Cluster identity Settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting identity Settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale Cluster identity Settings allow you to change the settings of identity
resource "powerscale_cluster_identity" "example_identity_settings" {
  # Optional fields both for creating and updating

  # The name for this cluster.
  # It must contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.
  # Spaces are not allowed.
  # The name must be unique within the cluster.
  name = "cluster1"

  # The description of the cluster.
  description = "cluster1 description"

  # The information displayed when a user logs in to the cluster.
  logon = {
    # The message of the day.
    motd = "motd"
    # The header to the message of the day.
    motd_header = "motd header"
  }
}
# After the execution of above resource block, Cluster identity Settings would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# identity Settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
