# Available actions: Create, Update (name, path, custom_auth_providers), Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new access zone with the name set in `name` attribute on the PowerScale

# PowerScale access zones allow you to isolate data and control who can access data in each zone.
resource "powerscale_accesszone" "zone" {

  # Required name of the new access zone
  name = "testAccessZone3"

  # Required Groupnet identifier to be assoicated with this access zone
  # Note can not be changed after the access zone is created
  groupnet = "groupnet0"

  # Required Specifies the access zone base directory path
  path = "/ifs"

  # Optional pecifies the list of authentication providers available on this access zon
  custom_auth_providers = ["System"]
