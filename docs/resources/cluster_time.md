# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Cluster Time Details from PowerScale, and save to
# terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load Cluster Time Details (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting Cluster Time Details from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

resource "powerscale_cluster_time" "test" {
  date = "01/12/2024"
  time = "00:32"
  path = "Asia/Kolkata"
}

# After the execution of above resource block, Cluster Time Settings would have been cached in terraform state file, and
# Cluster Time Settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
