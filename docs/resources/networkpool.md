# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file for the first time, you will create a network pool on the PowerScale

# PowerScale network pool allows you to add network interfaces to network pools to associate address ranges with a node or a group of nodes.

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_networkpool.pool_test groupnet_name.subnet_name.pool_name
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_networkpool.pool_test groupnet0.subnet0.pool_test
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
