# Available actions: Create, Update (owner, group, access_control), Delete and Import existing FileSystem(Namespace directory) from Powerscale array.
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new FileSystem(Namespace directory) with the name set in `name` attribute in the directory path provided in `directory_path`on the PowerScale array

# PowerScale FileSystem Resource allows you to manage the Namespace Directory on the Powerscale array
resource "powerscale_filesystem" "file_system_test" {

    name = "wheel"
    type = "group"
  }
  owner = {
    id   = "UID:1501",
    name = "Guest",
    type = "user"
  }

  # Optional attributes. Default values set.
  # Creates intermediate folders recursively, when set to true.
  recursive = true
  # Deletes and replaces the existing user attributes and ACLs of the directory with user-specified attributes and ACLS, when set to true.

  /* Optional : The ACL value for the directory. Users can either provide access rights input such as 'private_read' , 'private' ,
    'public_read', 'public_read_write', 'public' or permissions in POSIX format as '0550', '0770', '0775','0777' or 0700. The Default value is (0700). 
     Modification of ACL is only supported from POSIX to POSIX mode. 
  */

  # access_control = "0777"
}
# After the execution of above resource block, a PowerScale FileSystem(Namespace directory) would have been created at PowerScale array. You can also verify the changes made in terraform state file.
```
After the execution of above resource block, a powerscale_filesystem would have been created at PowerScale array

### Required

- `group` (Attributes) The group of the Filesystem.(Update Supported) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--group))
- `name` (String) FileSystem directory name
- `owner` (Attributes) The owner of the Filesystem.(Update Supported) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))

				'public_read', 'public_read_write', 'public' or permissions in POSIX format as '0550', '0770', '0775','0777' or 0700. The Default value is (0700). 
				(Update Supported but Modification of ACL is only supported from POSIX to POSIX mode)
- `directory_path` (String) FileSystem directory path.This specifies the path to the FileSystem(Namespace directory) which we are trying to manage. If no directory path is specified, [/ifs] would be taken by default.
- `id` (String) FileSystem identifier. Unique identifier for the FileSystem(Namespace directory)
- `overwrite` (Boolean) Deletes and replaces the existing user attributes and ACLs of the directory with user-specified attributes if set to true.
- `recursive` (Boolean) Creates intermediate folders recursively when set to true.

### Read-Only

- `authoritative` (String) If the directory has access rights set, then this field returns acl. Otherwise it returns mode.
- `creation_time` (String) File System Resource Creation time
- `mode` (String) Acl mode
- `type` (String) File System Resource type

<a id="nestedatt--group"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group`

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_filesystem.file_system_test <name>
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_filesystem.file_system_test ifs/DirTf
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
