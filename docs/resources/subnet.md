# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new subnet with the name set in `name` attribute on the PowerScale

# PowerScale subnet allows you to manage the subnet on the Powerscale array
resource "powerscale_subnet" "subnet" {

  # Required. Name of the new subnet
  name = "subnet1"

  # Required. Name of the groupnet this subnet belongs to
  # Updating is not allowed
  # when managing resource together with groupnet, recommend:
  # groupnet = powerscale_groupnet.example_groupnet.name
  groupnet = "groupnet0"

  # Required. IP address format
  addr_family = "ipv4"

  # Required. Subnet Prefix Length
  prefixlen = 21

  # Optional fields both for creating and updating
  #  description = "terraform subnet"
  #  dsr_addrs = []
  #  gateway="0.0.0.0"
  #  gateway_priority=10
  #  mtu=1500
  #  sc_service_addrs=[{
  #    high="0.0.0.0"
  #    low="0.0.0.0"
  #  }]
  #  sc_service_name=""
  #  vlan_enabled=true
  #  vlan_id=1
}

# After the execution of above resource block, subnet would have been created on the PowerScale array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_subnet.subnet <groupnet_id>.<subnet_id>
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_subnet.subnet groupnet0.subnet0
# after running this command, populate the name field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
