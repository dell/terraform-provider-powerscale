# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create S3 Bucket on specified paths on the PowerScale Array.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale S3 Bucket enables access to file-based data that is stored on OneFS clusters as objects.

resource "powerscale_s3_bucket" "s3_bucket_example" {
  # Required attributes and update not supported
  name = "s3-bucket-example"
  path = "/ifs/s3_bucket_example"

  # Optional attributes and update not supported, 
  # Their default value shows as below if not provided during creation 
  # create_path = false
  # owner = "root"
  # zone = "System"

  # Optional attributes, can be updated
  #
  # By default acl is an empty list. To add an acl item, both grantee and permission are required.
  # Accepted values for permission are: READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, WRITE_ACP, FULL_CONTROL 
  # acl = [{
  #   grantee = {
  #     name = "root"
  #     type = "user"
  #   }
  #   permission = "FULL_CONTROL"
  # }]
  #
  # By default description is empty
  # description = ""
  #
  # Accepted values for object_acl_policy are: replace, deny.
  # The default value would be replace if unset.
  # object_acl_policy = "replace"
}

# After the execution of above resource block, a S3 Bucket would have been created on the PowerScale array.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
