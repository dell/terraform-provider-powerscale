# powerscale_smb_share (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the SMB share entity on PowerScale array. PowerScale SMB shares provide clients network access to file system resources on the cluster. We can Create, Update and Delete the SMB share using this resource. We can also import an existing SMB Share from PowerScale array.


## Example Usage

```terraform

# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create NFS export on specified paths on the PowerScale Array.
