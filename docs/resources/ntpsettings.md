# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load NTP Settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load NTP Settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting NTP Settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale NTP Settings allow you to change the settings of NTP Servers
resource "powerscale_ntpsettings" "example_ntp_settings" {
  # Optional fields both for creating and updating
  #   chimers = 1
  #   excluded = ["1","2"]
  #   key_file = "/ifs/"
}

# After the execution of above resource block, NTP Settings would have been cached in terraform state file, or
# NTP Settings would have been updated on PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
