# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load Cluster Owner Details from PowerScale, and save to
# terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load Cluster Owner Details (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting Cluster Owner Details from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.
