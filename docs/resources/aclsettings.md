# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load ACL Settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load ACL Settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting ACL Settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale ACL Settings allow you to manage file and directory permissions, referred to as access rights.
