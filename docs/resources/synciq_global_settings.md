# Available actions: Create and  Update updates the syncIQ  global settings. Delete will delete the state file. Import action is also available
# After `terraform apply` of this example file will update the settings according to the attributes set in the config

# PowerScale SynIQ global settings allows you to manage the global settings on the Powerscale array
resource "powerscale_synciq_global_settings" "example" {
  preferred_rpo_alert = 3
  source_network = {
    subnet = "subnet0"
    pool   = "pool0"
  }
  report_email            = ["example1@mail.com", "example2@mail.com"]

  rpo_alerts              = true
  restrict_target_network = true
  report_max_count        = 2000
}

# There are other attributes as well. Please refer the documentation.
# After the execution of above resource block, settings would have been updated on the PowerScale array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Optional

- `bandwidth_reservation_reserve_absolute` (Number) The amount of SyncIQ bandwidth to reserve in kb/s for policies that did not specify a bandwidth reservation. This field takes precedence over bandwidth_reservation_reserve_percentage.
- `bandwidth_reservation_reserve_percentage` (Number) The percentage of SyncIQ bandwidth to reserve for policies that did not specify a bandwidth reservation.
- `cluster_certificate_id` (String) The ID of this cluster's certificate being used for encryption.
- `encryption_cipher_list` (String) The cipher list being used with encryption. For SyncIQ targets, this list serves as a list of supported ciphers. For SyncIQ sources, the list of ciphers will be attempted to be used in order.
- `encryption_required` (Boolean) If true, requires all SyncIQ policies to utilize encrypted communications.
- `force_interface` (Boolean) NOTE: This field should not be changed without the help of PowerScale support.  Default for the "force_interface" property that will be applied to each new sync policy unless otherwise specified at the time of policy creation.  Determines whether data is sent only through the subnet and pool specified in the "source_network" field. This option can be useful if there are multiple interfaces for the given source subnet.
- `max_concurrent_jobs` (Number) The max concurrent jobs that SyncIQ can support. This number is based on the size of the current cluster and the current SyncIQ worker throttle rule.
- `ocsp_address` (String) The address of the OCSP responder to which to connect.
- `ocsp_issuer_certificate_id` (String) The ID of the certificate authority that issued the certificate whose revocation status is being checked.
- `preferred_rpo_alert` (Number) If specified, display as default RPO Alert value for new policy creation via WebUI.
- `renegotiation_period` (Number) If specified, the duration to persist encrypted connection before forcing a renegotiation.
- `report_email` (Set of String) Email sync reports to these addresses.
- `report_max_age` (Number) ID of the Cluster Email Settings.
- `report_max_count` (Number) The default length of time (in seconds) a policy report will be stored.
- `restrict_target_network` (Boolean) Default for the "restrict_target_network" property that will be applied to each new sync policy unless otherwise specified at the time of policy creation.  If you specify true, and you specify a SmartConnect zone in the "target_host" field, replication policies will connect only to nodes in the specified SmartConnect zone.  If you specify false, replication policies are not restricted to specific nodes on the target cluster.
- `rpo_alerts` (Boolean) If disabled, no RPO alerts will be generated.
- `service` (String) Specifies if the SyncIQ service currently on, paused, or off.  If paused, all sync jobs will be paused.  If turned off, all jobs will be canceled.
- `service_history_max_age` (Number) Maximum age of service information to maintain, in seconds.
- `service_history_max_count` (Number) Maximum number of historical service information records to maintain.
- `source_network` (Attributes) Restricts replication policies on the local cluster to running on the specified subnet and pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source_network))
- `tw_chkpt_interval` (Number) The interval (in seconds) in which treewalk syncs are forced to checkpoint.
- `use_workers_per_node` (Boolean) If enabled, SyncIQ will use the deprecated workers_per_node field with worker pools functionality and limit workers accordingly.

### Nested Schema for `source_network`

Optional:

- `pool` (String) The pool to restrict replication policies to.
- `subnet` (String) The subnet to restrict replication policies to.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

# The command is

# Example:
terraform import powerscale_synciq_global_settings.settings global_setting
# after running this command, populate the  other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
