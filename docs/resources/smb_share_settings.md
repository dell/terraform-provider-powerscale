## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_smb_share_settings.example zone 
terraform import powerscale_smb_share_settings.example tfaccAccessZone
# after running this command, populate the zone field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
