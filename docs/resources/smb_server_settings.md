# powerscale_smb_server_settings (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the SMB Server Settings of PowerScale Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the SMB Server Settings using this resource.  
		Note that, SMB Server Settings is the native functionality of PowerScale. When creating the resource, we actually load SMB Server Settings from PowerScale to the resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform

# Available actions: Create, Update, Delete and Import.
# If resource arguments are omitted, `terraform apply` will load SMB server settings from PowerScale, and save to terraform state file.
# If any resource arguments are specified, `terraform apply` will try to load SMB server settings (if not loaded) and update the settings.
# `terraform destroy` will delete the resource from terraform state file rather than deleting SMB server settings from PowerScale.
# For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# PowerScale SMB server settings allow you to configure SMB server settings on PowerScale.

# The command is
# terraform import powerscale_smb_server_settings.example scope
# Example:
terraform import powerscale_smb_server_settings.example effective
# after running this command, populate the scope field and other required parameters in the config file to start managing this resource.
# Note: running "terraform show" after importing shows the current config/state of the resource. You can copy/paste that config to make it easier to manage the resource.
