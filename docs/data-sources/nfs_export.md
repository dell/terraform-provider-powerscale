# PowerScale provides an NFS server so you can share files on your cluster

# Returns a list of PowerScale NFS exports based on id and path filter block
data "powerscale_nfs_export" "test" {
  filter = {
    # Used for locally filtering id and path
    ids   = [1, 2, 3]
    paths = ["/ifs/primary", "/ifs/secondary"]

    # Used for query parameter, supported by PowerScale Platform API
    # check = true
    # dir   = "ASC"
    # limit = 10
    # offset= 1
    # path  = "/ifs/primary"
    # resume= "resume_token"
    # scope = "user"
    # sort  = "id"
    # zone  = "System"
  }
}

# Output value of above block by executing 'terraform output' command
# The user can use the fetched information by the variable data.powerscale_nfs_export.example_nfs_exports
output "powerscale_nfs_export" {
  value = data.powerscale_nfs_export.example_nfs_exports
}

# Returns all of the PowerScale SMB shares in default zone
data "powerscale_nfs_export" "all" {
}

# Output value of above block by executing 'terraform output' command
# The user can use the fetched information by the variable data.powerscale_nfs_export.all
output "powerscale_nfs_export" {
  value = data.powerscale_nfs_export.all
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.
Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable data
