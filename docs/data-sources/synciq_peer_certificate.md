## Schema

### Optional

- `id` (String) ID of the SyncIQ Peer Certificate to be fetched. If not provided, all the certificates will be fetched.

### Read-Only

### Nested Schema for `certificates`

Read-Only:

- `description` (String) Description field associated with a certificate provided for administrative convenience.
- `fingerprints` (Attributes List) A list of zero or more certificate fingerprints which can be used for certificate identification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--certificates--fingerprints))
- `id` (String) Unique server certificate identifier.
- `issuer` (String) Certificate issuer field extracted from the certificate.
- `name` (String) Administrator specified name identifier.
- `not_after` (Number) Certificate notAfter field extracted from the certificate encoded as a UNIX epoch timestamp.  The certificate is not valid after this timestamp.
