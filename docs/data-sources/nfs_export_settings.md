## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Identifier
- `nfs_export_settings` (Attributes) NFS Export Settings (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--nfs_export_settings))

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Optional:

- `scope` (String) If specified as "effective" or not specified, all fields are returned. If specified as "user", only fields with non-default values are shown. If specified as "default", the original values are returned.
- `zone` (String) Specifies which access zone to use.


<a id="nestedatt--nfs_export_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `nfs_export_settings`

Read-Only:

- `all_dirs` (Boolean) True if all directories under the specified paths are mountable.
- `block_size` (Number) Specifies the block size returned by the NFS statfs procedure.
- `can_set_time` (Boolean) True if the client can set file times through the NFS set attribute request. This parameter does not affect server behavior, but is included to accommodate legacy client requirements.
- `case_insensitive` (Boolean) True if the case is ignored for file names. This parameter does not affect server behavior, but is included to accommodate legacy client requirements.
- `case_preserving` (Boolean) True if the case is preserved for file names. This parameter does not affect server behavior, but is included to accommodate legacy client requirements.
- `chown_restricted` (Boolean) True if the superuser can change file ownership. This parameter does not affect server behavior, but is included to accommodate legacy client requirements.
- `commit_asynchronous` (Boolean) True if NFS  commit  requests execute asynchronously.
- `directory_transfer_size` (Number) Specifies the preferred size for directory read operations. This value is used to advise the client of optimal settings for the server, but is not enforced.
- `encoding` (String) Specifies the default character set encoding of the clients connecting to the export, unless otherwise specified.
- `link_max` (Number) Specifies the reported maximum number of links to a file. This parameter does not affect server behavior, but is included to accommodate legacy client requirements.

- `read_only` (Boolean) True if the export is set to read-only.
- `read_transfer_max_size` (Number) Specifies the maximum buffer size that clients should use on NFS read requests. This value is used to advise the client of optimal settings for the server, but is not enforced.
- `read_transfer_multiple` (Number) Specifies the preferred multiple size for NFS read requests. This value is used to advise the client of optimal settings for the server, but is not enforced.
- `read_transfer_size` (Number) Specifies the preferred size for NFS read requests. This value is used to advise the client of optimal settings for the server, but is not enforced.
- `readdirplus` (Boolean) True if 'readdirplus' requests are enabled. Enabling this property might improve network performance and is only available for NFSv3.
- `readdirplus_prefetch` (Number) Sets the number of directory entries that are prefetched when a 'readdirplus' request is processed. (Deprecated.)
- `return_32bit_file_ids` (Boolean) Limits the size of file identifiers returned by NFSv3+ to 32-bit values (may require remount).
- `security_flavors` (List of String) Specifies the authentication types that are supported for this export.
- `setattr_asynchronous` (Boolean) True if set attribute operations execute asynchronously.
- `snapshot` (String) Specifies the snapshot for all mounts.

- `write_transfer_multiple` (Number) Specifies the preferred multiple size for NFS write requests. This value is used to advise the client of optimal settings for the server, but is not enforced.
- `write_transfer_size` (Number) Specifies the preferred multiple size for NFS write requests. This value is used to advise the client of optimal settings for the server, but is not enforced.
- `write_unstable_action` (String) Specifies the action to be taken when an NFSv3+ unstable write is requested.
- `write_unstable_reply` (String) Specifies the stability disposition returned when an NFSv3+ unstable write is processed.
- `zone` (String) Specifies the zone in which the export is valid.
