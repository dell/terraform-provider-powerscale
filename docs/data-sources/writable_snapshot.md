# PowerScale Writable Snapshots allows you to get a list of Writable Snapshots or a Writable Snapshot by its Path which can be added in filters.

# Returns a list of PowerScale Writable Snapshots 
data "powerscale_writable_snapshot" "all_snaps" {
}

# Returns a the PowerScale Writable Snapshot with given Path
data "powerscale_writable_snapshot" "test" {
  filter {
    path  = "/ifs/path/to/writable/snap"
    limit = 5
  }
}

# Output value of above block by executing 'terraform output' command.
# The user can use the fetched information by the variable data.powerscale_writable_snapshot.all_snaps.writable
# output "powerscale_writable_snapshot" {
#   value = data.powerscale_writable_snapshot.all_snaps.writable
# }

# After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Optional:

- `dir` (String) The direction of the sort.
- `limit` (Number) Return no more than this many results at once (see resume).
- `path` (String) Only list writable snapshots matching this path.
- `resume` (String) Continue returning results from previous call using this token (token should come from the previous call, resume cannot be used with other options).
- `sort` (String) The field that will be used for sorting.  Choices are path, src name, src path, created, size and state. Default is created.
- `state` (String) Only list writable snapshots matching this state.

- `created` (Number) The Unix Epoch time the writable snapshot was created.
- `dst_path` (String) The user supplied /ifs path of writable snapshot.
- `id` (Number) The system ID given to the writable snapshot. This is useful for debugging.
- `log_size` (Number) The sum in bytes of logical size of files in this writable snapshot.
- `phys_size` (Number) The amount of storage in bytes used to store this writable snapshot.
- `src_id` (Number) The system ID of the user supplied source snapshot. This is useful for debugging.
- `src_path` (String) The /ifs path of user supplied source snapshot. This will be null for writable snapshots pending delete.
