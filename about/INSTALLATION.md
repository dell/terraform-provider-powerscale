# Installation of Terraform Provider for Dell PowerScale

## Installation from public repository

The provider will be fetched from the public repository and installed by Terraform automatically.
Create a file called `main.tf` in your workspace with the following contents

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerscale = { 
      version = "1.0.0"
      source = "registry.terraform.io/dell/powerscale"
    }
  }
}
```
Then, in that workspace, run
```
terraform init
``` 

## Installation from source code

1. Clone this repo
2. In the root of this repo run
```
make install
```
Then follow [installation from public repo](#installation-from-public-repository)

## Usage
Once you have installed the PowerScale provider, you can start using it in your Terraform configuration files. The provider has a number of resources that you can use to manage your PowerScale storage arrays.

For example, you can use the `powerscale_accesszone` resource to create a new access zone:
```terraform
resource "powerscale_accesszone" "zone" {
  # Required fields
  name     = "testAccessZone"
  groupnet = "groupnet0"
  path     = "/ifs"

  # Optional to apply Auth Providers
  custom_auth_providers = ["System"]
}
```

## SSL Certificate Verification

For SSL verifcation on RHEL, below steps can be performed:
 * Copy the CA certificate to the `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` path of the host by any external means.
 * Import the SSL certificate to host by running
```
update-ca-trust extract
```
